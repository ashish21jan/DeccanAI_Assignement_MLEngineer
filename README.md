###House Price Prediction: End-to-End Machine Learning Project###

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for predicting house prices using a publicly available dataset (California Housing Dataset). It covers:

1. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, scaling, encoding).
2. Model Training & Evaluation (comparing multiple regressors, hyperparameter tuning).
3. Model Deployment (serving predictions via a REST API).
4. Project Report & Documentation (summarizing the approach and how to use the code).

      Project Overview
      Objective:
      Predict house prices based on a variety of attributes (e.g., lot area, number of rooms, location). This project demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for modeling.
2. Model Training & Evaluation: Training regression models, measuring performance (RMSE, MAE, R²), and tuning hyperparameters.
3. Deployment: Exposing the final model for real-time predictions via a REST API.
4. Documentation: Explaining each step and providing usage instructions.

   
Dataset
Source: California Housing dataset from Kaggle.


Covers data loading, handling missing values, basic feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Final_Projects_Kaggle.ipynb

Performs thorough feature engineering, model selection (multiple algorithms), hyperparameter tuning, and final model evaluation.
Outputs the best-performing model saved as finalized_model.pkl.
Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Dependencies:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebooks (if desired for exploration and training):

Open Jupyter or any compatible environment.
Launch HandleTestData.ipynb or Final_Projects_Kaggle.ipynb.
Follow the notebook cells in order to replicate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Data Preprocessing
Outlined in HandleTestData.ipynb:

EDA: Identifies missing values, outliers, and key correlations between features and the target.
Missing Value Treatment: Uses strategies such as imputation or dropping rows/columns, depending on data patterns.
Encoding & Scaling: Transforms categorical features (e.g., One-Hot Encoding) and scales numerical features if needed.
Feature Engineering: Creates new variables or combines existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training & Evaluation
Detailed in Final_Projects_Kaggle.ipynb:

Train/Test Split: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Model Comparisons: Tries algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses methods (like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize key parameters.
Metrics: Evaluates models via RMSE, MAE, and R² to quantify predictive performance.
Final Model: After tuning, the best model is saved as finalized_model.pkl for deployment.
Model Deployment
The script Deployment_Model.py creates a REST API (using Flask or FastAPI) to serve predictions from finalized_model.pkl. It:

Loads the trained model from finalized_model.pkl.
Defines an endpoint (e.g., /predict) that:
Accepts input features in JSON format.
Returns a predicted house price as a JSON response.
Users can send requests to this endpoint via Postman, curl, or any HTTP client to get real-time predictions.

Usage Guide
Train a Model

If you want to replicate training, run Final_Projects_Kaggle.ipynb.
This notebook outputs finalized_model.pkl once the best model is identified.

Start the API
python Deployment_Model.py
This launches the server on a specified host/port (commonly http://127.0.0.1:5000 or similar).
Send a Prediction Request

Using Postman or curl, create a POST request to http://localhost:5000/predict.
Include the features in JSON format. The script returns the predicted price as a JSON response.
Report & Documentation
Jupyter Notebooks:
HandleTestData.ipynb and Final_Projects_Kaggle.ipynb document data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation.
Deployment_Model.py:
Contains the API implementation details and explains how predictions are generated.
